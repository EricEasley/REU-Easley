Changes we discussed:
1. Move memory allocation outside convolve()
2. Swap the if on HWC/CHW and the for loop on ITERATIONS
3. Split channels into input channels and output channels
4. Remove omap from convole(.)
5. Check if the HWC implementation of loop nest is efficient. Maybe the for loop on c must be nested under the
for loops for i and j.
